# Stats

Stats is a high-performance, standalone analytics provider designed for self-hosting, enabling the collection and viewing of event data from websites, apps, and more through a web API. It comes with a real-time dashboard and is ideal as a minimal and privacy-preserving analytics solution for small to medium traffic services.

### Key-features

- Real-time analytics and dashboard
- Lightweight and efficient, with minimal resource usage
- Easy integration with websites, mobile apps, and other platforms

# Local development

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) - V1.77>
- [Diesel CLI](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started)

## Steps

1. Create a `.env` file following the example provided by `.env.example`. See [Configuration](#Configuration) for details on the values.

2. Run the stored migrations: `diesel migration run`

3. For event location data you will need to add the [GeoLite2-City.mmdb](https://git.io/GeoLite2-City.mmdb) & [cities5000](ttps://github.com/PrismaPhonic/filter-cities-by-country/raw/master/cities5000.txt) files to `/data`

# Getting started

To get started with Stats, you'll need to compile an executable for your server, run it, and host it. While this guide focuses on using Nginx as a reverse proxy, Stats is versatile enough to be deployed in various environments, including Docker containers, for enhanced portability and scalability.

**Run in development-mode**

```
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

**Build production release**

```
cargo build --release
```

This will create the executable file you need in the /target/release/ folder

**Embed events collector** <br/>
You use this to automatically collect pageviews or other events triggered by calling `stats_collect('event_name', 'optinal_url_override')` from javascript once the script below is initialized.

When you add this script to a new domain, you must add them to the `CORS_DOMAINS` list on the backend so the server can receive data from them.

```js
<script>
  // Stats analytics var head = document.head ||
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]; var script =
  document.createElement("script"); script.setAttribute("src",
  "http://localhost:5775/stats.js"); // REPLACE WITH ACTUAL URL
  script.setAttribute("onload", () => window.collectStats());
  script.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript"); script.setAttribute("charset",
  "utf8"); script.setAttribute("async", ""); head.appendChild(script);
</script>
```

## Setup

Minimum set of folders & files required to run this application.

```
stats/
├── data/
│ ├── GeoLite2-City.mmdb
│ ├── cities5000.txt
│ └── stats.sqlite
├── ui/
├── stats // copy executable from target/release/stats
└── .env
```

# Configuration

These options must be defined in a `.env` file before starting the server.
